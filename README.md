### Access

- The project is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed by visiting this link [Weather App](https://baha-homidov.github.io/weather-app/)


### Motivation

This project contains many newly learned technologies and implementations. Some of them are:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Asynchronous JavaSpcript and working with APIs


This project has a good use case of those technologies I've ventured into, and it was an excellent platform to put them into practice.

### Features

- Searching cities by name and displaying an output if there are no results
- Asynchronously calling an API and displaying data
